A sample parcel distribution center

You work at a parcel delivery company, and you are asked to design a system to automate the internal handling of parcels coming in. The parcels are coming in at the distribution center and need to be handled by different departments based on their weight and value. Currently, management is making plans that could lead to the addition or removal of departments in the future.

## Features

### Feature 1
The current business rules are as follows:
- Parcels with a weight up to 1 kg are handled by the "Mail" department.
- Parcels with a weight up to 10 kg are handled by the "Regular" department.
- Parcels with a weight over 10 kg are handled by the "Heavy" department.

### Feature 2
Parcels with a value of over â‚¬ 1000,- need to be signed off by the "Insurance" department,
before being processed by the other departments.

### Feature 3 (optional)
The company has decided to productize the software and sell it under a license
subscription model. The business rules will vary per customer and need to be
configurable.
